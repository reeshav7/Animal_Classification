# 🐾 Animal Image Classification (ANN vs CNN)

This project implements an **Animal Image Classification system** that compares **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image recognition. The system includes a **GUI-based application** that allows users to upload images and obtain real-time predictions with confidence scores.

##  Project Overview

Image classification is a core problem in computer vision. In this project, two different approaches are explored:

- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** with PCA-based feature reduction  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** using transfer learning (MobileNetV2)

The objective is to understand the limitations of traditional ANN models for image data and demonstrate why CNNs perform better for vision-based tasks.
